GitHub File Uploader Script.py

This script allows users to upload a local file to a GitHub repository.

Usage:
1. Replace 'your_username', 'your_password' (or 'your_access_token'), and 'your_repository'
   with your actual GitHub username, password (or access token), and repository name.
2. Specify the file path of the file you want to upload in the 'file_path' variable.

Note: For security reasons, it's recommended to use an access token instead of your password.
